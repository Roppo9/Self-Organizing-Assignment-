                <p class="lead"> Self-discipline is one of the harder ideas to implement into a business because it is something that is on a person-to-person basis. Not everyone possesses the same amount of self-discipline in a company, so it is something that can only be encouraged by the group leaders and managers. If a member of a group lacks self-discipline, then the work that they do may either be lack luster or received late compared to the other group members.

If a leader is willing to put time and effort into their work, then the employees that work for them, or the other members of the group that they
                        are working in, will be motivated to do the same. If a leader is able to overcome temptations and resist their impulses, everyone else will notice, and focus on the work that they need to get done.</p></div>
                    <div class="col-lg-4 mr-auto"><p class="lead">If businesses had leaders without self-discipline, there wouldn’t be any work getting done consistently. This would be due to the fact that the 
                        leaders would often get sidetracked since they would not be able to focus on what needs to be done. Their group partners would see this behavior and either do the same or get demotivated and give up on the work that is given to them. Either way, having a leader without self-discipline wouldn’t be good for running a business 
                        if that businesses priority is getting work done in a timely and orderly fashion.</p></div>

As long as that leader is able to stay self-disciplined, work will consistently be getting done. Not only will these leaders be able to boost productivity, but they will also improve the atmosphere in the workplace since self-discipline tends to increase self-esteem and work ethic. 
                        Those who work with a leader who is determined to get the work done will feel better about the work that they do if they are trying to work as hard as them.</p></div>

In this scenario is it best to provide the employee what is expected of them so that they know what they must do. If they know that you want to see improvement in their initiative and problem solving, then it is best to let them know that is what you expect from them. 
                        If they know what is important to you and the business that you are running, they will know what the goals that they should have when completing their work.</p></div>

In this situation, it is important to consider what is important to the person you are rewarding since it would motivate them more if they rewarded correctly. 
                    These rewards are important because it helps communicate to the person you are working with that you appreciate the hard work they put in, and it also is able to increase or maintain the productivity that they have.</p></div>
